                        <p>A launch vehicle or carrier rocket is a rocket-propelled vehicle used to carry a payload from Earth's surface to space, usually to Earth orbit or bryond. Our WEB-X carrier rocket is the most powerful in operation. Standing 150 meters tall, it's quite an awe-inspiring sight on the launch pad!</p>
